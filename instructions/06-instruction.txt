 Promise It Won’t Hurt

 Shortcuts
 Exercise 6 of 13


# Promise me... quicker

The ES2015 specification defines some shortcuts that make creating and working
with promises faster and easier.

The first is .catch. So far we already know how to handle the rejection of a
promise -- through the second parameter to .then function. However,
sometimes you only want to handle the rejection and not success. In these
cases, since the onFulfilled callback is optional, you can specify null in
place of it.  However, a much easier way to achieve this is to use .catch.
Instead of having to write

    promise.then(null, function (err) {
      console.error('THERE IS AN ERROR!!!');
      console.error(err.message);
    });

You could simply write

    promise.catch(function (err) {
      console.error('THERE IS AN ERROR!!!');
      console.error(err.message);
    });

This notation also has the benefit of making the easier to understand for
people who do not speak Promises yet, since it is fairly obvious to everyone
who has done JavaScript programming to understand what catch means.

The second and third are Promise.resolve and Promise.reject. The code
examples below will tell you exactly what they do:

    // The way you have learned: create promise through the constructor.

    var promise = new Promise(function (fulfill, reject) {
      fulfill('SECRET VALUE');
    });

    // Introducing: Promise.resolve
    // It does the exact same thing as above:

    var promise = Promise.resolve('SECRET VALUE');


    // Likewise...

    var promise = new Promise(function (fulfill, reject) {
      reject(new Error('SECRET VALUE'));
    });

    var promise = Promise.reject(new Error('SECRET VALUE'));

## Task

We don’t have any specific task we’d like to assign to you for this lesson.
Feel free to explore all three functions at your own pace. When you are
preparing to submit though, make sure you are using at least catch and one
of Promise.resolve and Promise.reject ☺
